This project requires a print bed at least 200mm square. `.STL` files may need to be modified for thicker or thinner shield material. Additional material recommendations and assembly instructions can be found at the site above or in the [PDF provided by Prusa and included in this folder](./PrusaFaceShieldGuide.pdf).

BLDG 61 will print using PETg filament with a 2mm wall thickness and 30% infill density. STLs were arranged nested to maximize parts per build. STLs were not stacked to avoid sharp edges and manual cleanup left from supports. Parts are printed with LulzBot TAZ 5 and TAZ 6 3D printers with PEI film on the bed.

Recommended PETG settings: Extruder Temp: 230⁰ C, Bed Temp: 70⁰ C
